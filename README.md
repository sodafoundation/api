## Introduction

The **SODA API** is a part of the SODA Foundation's mission to simplify and unify data and storage management. As an open-source implementation of the SODA API Standards, this project establishes a universal interface for various data operations. Whether it's storage provisioning, data migration, or other key features, the SODA API ensures compatibility with a wide array of storage backends.

Being storage agnostic, any application or client platform can easily integrate with SODA API. Furthermore, the flexibility of the API allows for the development of northbound plugins that can seamlessly translate platform-specific specifications into the SODA standard.

**Key Features:**
- Storage Provisioning
- Data Migration
- File Sharing
- Block and File APIs
- Platform Agnostic Framework

**Repositories**:
