# Contributing To The OpenStack SDK for Go

This SDK provides an SDK to interact with [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) for
applications written in Go. There are a few ways to contribute to the SDK.

## Bugs and Feature Requests

Bugs and feature requests are tracked in launchpad.

* Bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/golang-client
* Features: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/golang-client

When filing an issue please fill in as many details as possible.

## Contributing

Before contributing to the SDK you will need to get setup to [contribute within
the OpenStack community](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html).

Since this SDK is designed to work against an OpenStack setup you'll need an
existing OpenStack cloud or [DevStack](http://devstack.org) for integration
testing and to work with.
